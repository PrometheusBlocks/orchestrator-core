# Self-Improvement Capabilities

The orchestrator can now improve its own capabilities through natural language commands.

## Usage

```bash
python -m orchestrator_core.cli improve "add file search capability"
python -m orchestrator_core.cli improve "enhance natural language understanding"
python -m orchestrator_core.cli improve "create web scraping utility"
```

## How It Works

1. **Planning**: Analyzes the request and creates a step-by-step plan
2. **Safety Check**: Shows what will be modified and asks for confirmation  
3. **Execution**: Carries out the plan step by step
4. **Verification**: Reports success/failure of each step

## Safety Features

- Always asks for confirmation before making changes
- Shows exactly what files will be modified
- Creates new utilities in separate directories
- Fallback to safe defaults if AI planning fails

## Limitations

- Automatic code modification is limited (manual review required)
- Depends on OpenAI API (set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable)
- Generated code may need manual testing and refinement

## Next Steps

After successful self-improvement:
1. Test the new capabilities manually
2. Run existing tests to ensure nothing broke
3. Consider integrating new utilities into the main registry
